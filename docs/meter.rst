Meters
======

This application simply demonstrates two-rate three-color Mark (trTCM) policy
using P4 meters. The meter policy is configured to rate-limit traffic to a 
bandwidth limit of 1 KBps and a burst-size limit of 128 Bytes for green 
traffic. It also is configured to a peak bandwidth limit of 5 KBps and a peak 
burst-size limit of 256 Bytes for yellow traffic.

Running Demo
------------

We provide a small demo to let you test the program.

* run_switch.sh: compile the P4 program and starts the switch,
  also configures the data plane by running the CLI commands
* send_and_receive.py: send and receive packets

To run the demo:

* create virtual interfaces (need to run only if the VM has restarted)::

    sudo ../veth_setup.sh

* start the switch::

    sudo ./run_switch.sh


Sending Rate
------------

Each packet is 64B in size. You can adjust the inter-packet by option `-t`

Example 1
---------

Send 10 packets per second ~ (10 packets * 64 B/packet) = 640 B/s::

    sudo ./send_and_receive.py -c 100 -t 0.1

Because the throughput is below the first rate ( 1KB/s ), then all packets are
marked as green traffic which are then forwarded to port 1 (interface: `veth2`).


Example 2
---------

Send 15 packets per second ~ (16 packets * 64 B/packet) = 1024 B/s::

    sudo ./send_and_receive.py -c 100 -t 0.06

The throughput fluctuates around the first rate ( 1KB/s ), then most of packets are
marked as yellow traffic which are then forwarded to port 2 (interface: `veth4`).


Example 3
---------

Send 1000 packets per second ~ (1000 packets * 64 B/packet) > 5 KB/s

note: the software cannot send packets with precisely inter-gaps. Then it's safer
to minimize the inter-gaps for reaching the peak throughput::

    sudo ./send_and_receive.py -c 1000 -t 0.001

The throughput reached the peak rate ( 5 KB/s ), then most of packets are
marked as red traffic which are then drop.
