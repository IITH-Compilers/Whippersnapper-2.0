L2 Forwarding
=============

This application simply looks up on layer header and either drops or forwards
packets toward destination.

Running Demo
------------

We provide a small demo to let you test the program.

* run_switch.sh: compile the P4 program and starts the switch,
  also configures the data plane by running the CLI (commands.txt)
* icmp.pcap: ICMP packet to feed in the switch

To run the demo:

* create virtual interfaces (need to run only if the VM has restarted)::

    sudo ../veth_setup.sh

* start the switch::

    sudo ./run_switch.sh

* start tcpdump::

    sudo tcpdump -i veth2

* use tcpreplay to send packet::

    sudo tcpreplay -i veth4 ../pcap/icmp.pcap
